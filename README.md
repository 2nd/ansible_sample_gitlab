Ansible - Sample Gitlab Build
=============================

Sample Gitlab Install on Ubuntu - Ansible recipe

This was built for trying out gitlab in our lab environment.  It may not be the best way of doing things - we are neither an Ubuntu or a Ruby house - so are following prebuilt recipes.

I had some issues getting Gitlab to start after doing all this.  And I am not sure why it started working - but I subsequently demolished the environment and rebuilt from scratch, and this time it worked fineâ€¦ Sometimes software is too much like magic and the way you look at the server changes how it behaves!

I have excised a batch of specific references to our environments - and this also means that one of the included task files (standard_server.yml) has been completely gutted - this should make no difference to using the overall file.

There are only minor changes from the version which I use, but of course its always possible that I broke it in taking out our site specific configs.  If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.

This depends on a few things which we have defined in group variables.  For example the mail server config is in our group_vars/all file:-

    mail_server:
        host:       10.0.0.4
        port:       587
        domain:     development.example.com
        auth_user:  mailauthuser
        auth_pass:  mailauthpass
